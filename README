How to run:
- conbot
    - python3 conbot.py <hostname> <port> <channel> <secret>
    - channel cannot have '#' in it. That part is handled by the code
- bot
    - python3 bot.py <hostname> <port> <channel> <secret>
    - channel cannot have '#' in it. That part is handled by the code


conbot will send the secret as the first message after it joins a channel. 
anything the user type in to conbot will be sent. After a command is used
no command will be sent for 5 secs

***both conbot and bot will wait a few sec after joinning an irc server to
joinning a channel.
